Approach
Max possilbe move is 2. What ever is the configuration, queen can be captured in 2 moves
Now when ever the two pieces are head to head and the third pice is not in between them then we can capture queen in 1 step. This can be possible in 4 different ways :
rook and queen in same row
rook and queen in the same column
bishop and queen in the same anti- diagonal
bishop and queen in the same diagonal
Only check for above four cases along with the check that the 3rd piece is not in between two direct capture.
Complexity
Time complexity: O(1)

Space complexity: O(1)

code:
int minMovesToCaptureTheQueen(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f) {
    if(a == e && !(a == c && d > min(b,f) && d < max(b,f) )) return 1; //rook and queen in same row
    if(b == f && !(b == d && c > min(a,e) && c < max(a,e) ))  return 1;  //rook and queen in the same column
    if(c + d == e + f && !(c + d == a + b && a > min(c , e) && a < max(c, e) )) return 1;  //bishop and queen in the same anti- diagonal
    if(c-d == e-f && !( c-d == a-b && a > min(c , e) && a < max(c, e) )) return 1;  // bishop and queen in the same diagonal
    return 2;
}
